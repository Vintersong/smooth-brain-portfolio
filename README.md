# Andrei Moldovean - Portfolio Website

## About This Project

This is a **student assignment** for a Web Design course - a freelancing professional portfolio website built with Bootstrap 5.3. 

It's also **deliberately over-the-top** and satirical. The entire site is a tongue-in-cheek parody of cyberpunk aesthetics, vaporwave design trends, and self-aware tech humor. From the ".smooth-brain-designs" branding to the brain-morphing hamburger menu, nothing here should be taken too seriously.

## Features

- **Cyberpunk/Retro-Gaming Theme**: Neon glows, gradient borders, and glitch animations
- **Brain Hamburger Menu**: Custom SVG animation that transforms from a wrinkled brain into a smooth circle (because we're .smooth-brain-designs)
- **Fully Responsive**: Works on everything from Galaxy Note 20 down to tiny screens
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: Modern framework with custom CSS overrides
- **Satirical Content**: Fake projects, exaggerated descriptions, and self-aware comedy throughout

## Assignment Requirements Met

✅ All 7 minimal requirements + 1 optional requirement completed  
✅ Semantic HTML5 structure  
✅ Bootstrap responsive layout  
✅ Custom CSS styling  
✅ Navigation, images, modals, carousel  
✅ Git version control  

## The Gag

This portfolio pretends to showcase professional freelance work but is actually a collection of absurd. The entire aesthetic is intentionally excessive, poking fun at the overly-serious tech industry while still demonstrating technical competence.

**TL;DR:** It's a student assignment disguised as a cyberpunk portfolio disguised as satire. Or maybe it's satire disguised as a portfolio disguised as a student assignment. We're not entirely sure anymore.
