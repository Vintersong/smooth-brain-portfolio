# Andrei Moldovean - Portfolio Website

## About This Project

This is a **student assignment** for a Web Design course - a freelancing professional portfolio website built with Bootstrap 5.3.

It's also **deliberately over-the-top** and satirical. The entire site is a tongue-in-cheek parody of cyberpunk aesthetics, vaporwave design trends, and self-aware tech humor. From the ".smooth-brain-designs" branding to the brain-morphing hamburger menu, nothing here should be taken too seriously.

## Multi-Stack Architecture

This portfolio demonstrates technical range by using **different web technologies** across its pages:

| Page | Stack | Live URL | Description |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Main Hub (`index.html`) | Bootstrap 5.3 + Vanilla JS | [https://smooth-brain-designs.com](https://smooth-brain-designs.com) | The original static HTML portfolio |
| CV Page (`/cv`) | **Astro** | [https://smooth-brain-designs.com/cv](https://smooth-brain-designs.com/cv) | Component-based static site generator |
| Timeline (`/timeline`) | **React + Astro** | [https://smooth-brain-designs.com/timeline](https://smooth-brain-designs.com/timeline) | Interactive timeline with React components |
| *(Future)* Team | Astro Islands | - | Interactive Warcraft-themed character CVs |
| *(Future)* Projects | Vue/Three.js | - | 3D project showcase |

The goal is to showcase proficiency across multiple frameworks while maintaining consistent cyberpunk styling.

## Features

- **Cyberpunk/Retro-Gaming Theme**: Neon glows, gradient borders, and glitch animations
- **Brain Hamburger Menu**: Custom SVG animation that transforms from a wrinkled brain into a smooth circle (because we're .smooth-brain-designs)
- **Fully Responsive**: Works on everything from Galaxy Note 20 down to tiny screens
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: Modern framework with custom CSS overrides
- **Astro Integration**: CV page built with Astro components for cleaner code organization
- **Satirical Content**: Fake projects, exaggerated descriptions, and self-aware comedy throughout

## The Gag

This portfolio pretends to showcase professional freelance work but is actually a collection of absurd. The entire aesthetic is intentionally excessive, poking fun at the overly-serious tech industry while still demonstrating technical competence.

**TL;DR:** It's a student assignment disguised as a cyberpunk portfolio disguised as satire. Or maybe it's satire disguised as a portfolio disguised as a student assignment. We're not entirely sure anymore.
